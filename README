This is a cleaned up version of PowerUpSQL. 

In short, all the somewhat threatening sounding features for proof of concept exploitation has been removed, leaving only the configuration checks that I believe the majority would benefit from. 

Because many AV and anti-malware have flagged this script as malicious, most of the comments have also been removed. Some function names have also been renamed.
